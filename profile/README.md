![alt text](https://github.com/Zutari-CoDe/.github/blob/main/profile/github-logo.jpg?raw=true)

ðŸ‘‹ Greetings fellow CoDe's!! Welcome to the central source code organisation for all things CoDe related (launched 2024-01-17). The organisational repository serves to centrally host repositories related to projects or development work. Our aim is to streamline and standardise the development or scripts, code and related programming resources under a single domain, ensuring best practice is adopted and maintained as best as possible. The organisational page is principally maintained by the Computational Desing (CoDe) team within Zutari.

The .github folder will contain the organisational information and getting started information.
